\chapter{Conclusion}
 
A separate "Conclusions" section should be incorporated after the Discussion. A conclusion is a summary of your work, a reader that only reads the conclusion should still get the main contribution of your work. A good model of a conclusion is to think of it as an extended abstract in which you can put more stress on the results and why your work is important. Remember that it should be possible for a reader to read only the conclusion and not the rest of your paper, s/he should still get the main points of your work. You definitely need to end your paper with highlighting the significance of your work. Do not make the mistake of providing new information in a conclusion.

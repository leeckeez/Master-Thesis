\chapter{Design/Materials}

Requirements might be followed by a "Design" chapter, or an Architecture chapter, or a "Systems overview", or a similar title that describes you're the high-level designs. If necessary you can still split this up in several chapters. While not mandatory, if you did undertake efforts to evaluate the quality of your designs or high-level architectures, it is wise to include this information as well. Obviously, students should always try to justify the choices they made (technologies, components, interfaces, etc.)\par

With design choices always state your references \citep{Castleman98,Granlund95} or say that \citet{Holmes95} did good work on some subject.

\section{System Design}
At a system level, this part of the paper could contain:
\begin{itemize}
\item Mechanic components
\item User Interface components
\item Hardware and/or software partitioning
\item Hardware schemas of the main building blocks and interfaces between those building blocks
\item Software components and main interfaces between those components
\end{itemize}

Again, figures and schemas can certainly augment the legibility of the paper, however ensure to also describe the design or architecture in words.\par

\section{Component level Design}
At the component level, a detailed design of the different blocks or modules should be given (e.g. flow diagrams, class/sequence/state diagrams, etc.)\par

\chapter{Discussion}
 
The Discussion is harder to define than the other sections. It is usually the hardest section to write. 

Firstly, reflect on the problem or research question that you presented in the Introduction. 'frame' your results with respect to the research question or the problem you are trying to solve. Was your approach to solving the problem a good one? Was it the best? Would you recommend it to future engineers?

A discussion is also a place for reflection and for advice/warnings to other researchers. Here you can write how the research could still be improved and what future researchers should focus on. Point out any exceptions or any lack of correlation and define unsettled points. Never take the high-risk alternative of trying to cover up or fudge data that do not quite fit. If this is a particularly long section, it could also become a new section called "Future work".
